# OCM Example Service
---

This project is an example OCM microservice.

To help you while reading the code the service implements a simple collection
of _dinosaurs_, so you can immediately know when something is infrastructure or
business logic. Anything that talks about dinosaurs is business logic, which you
will replace with your business logic. The rest is infrastructure, and you
will probably want to preserve without change.

For a real service written using the same infrastructure see the
[Account Manager service](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/uhc-account-manager).

To contact the people that created this infrastructure go to the
[slack](https://coreos.slack.com/) [#forum-cluster-management](https://coreos.slack.com/archives/CBDNMS43V).

## Run for the first time

### Make a build and run postgres

```sh

# 1. build the project

$ go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest  
$ make binary

# 2. run a postgres database locally in docker 

$ make db/setup
$ make db/login
        
    root@f076ddf94520:/# psql -h localhost -U ocm_example_service ocmexample
    psql (14.4 (Debian 14.4-1.pgdg110+1))
    Type "help" for help.
    
    ocmexample=# \dt
    Did not find any relations.

```

### Run database migrations

The initial migration will create the base data model as well as providing a way to add future migrations.

```shell


# 3. specify the  environment
export OCM_ENV=development

# Run migrations
./ocm-example-service migrate

# Verify they ran in the database
$ make db/login

root@f076ddf94520:/# psql -h localhost -U ocm_example_service ocmexample
psql (14.4 (Debian 14.4-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

ocmexample=# \dt
                 List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type  |        Owner        
--------+------------+-------+---------------------
 public | dinosaurs  | table | ocm_example_service
 public | events     | table | ocm_example_service
 public | migrations | table | ocm_example_service
(2 rows)


```

### Test the application

```shell

$ make test
$ make test-integration

```

### Running the Service

```
./ocm-example-service serve
```

To verify that the server is working use the curl command:

$ curl http://localhost:8000//api/ocm-example-service/v1/dinosaurs | jq


That should return a 401 response like this, because it needs authentication:

```
{
  "kind": "Error",
  "id": "401",
  "href": "//api/ocm-example-service/errors/401",
  "code": "API-401",
  "reason": "Request doesn't contain the 'Authorization' header or the 'cs_jwt' cookie"
}
```


Authentication in the default configuration is done through the RedHat SSO, so you need to login with a Red Hat customer portal user in the right account (created as part of the onboarding doc) and then you can retrieve the token to use below on https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token
To authenticate, use the ocm tool against your local service:

### Get a new Dinosaur
This will be empty if no Dinosaur is ever created

```
(base) âžœ  ~ ocm get /api/ocm-example-service/v1/dinosaurs
{
  "items": [],
  "kind": "DinosaurList",
  "page": 1,
  "size": 0,
  "total": 0
}
```

### Post a new Dinosaur

```shell
ocm login --token=${OCM_ACCESS_TOKEN} --url=http://localhost:8000

ocm post /api/ocm-example-service/v1/dinosaurs << EOF
{
    "species": "foo"
}
EOF

```

#### Run in CRC

Use OpenShift Local to deploy to a local openshift cluster. Be sure to have CRC running locally:

```shell
$ crc status
CRC VM:          Running
OpenShift:       Running (v4.13.12)
RAM Usage:       7.709GB of 30.79GB
Disk Usage:      23.75GB of 32.68GB (Inside the CRC VM)
Cache Usage:     37.62GB
Cache Directory: /home/mturansk/.crc/cache
```

Log into CRC and try a deployment:

```shell

$ make crc/login
Logging into CRC
Logged into "https://api.crc.testing:6443" as "kubeadmin" using existing credentials.

You have access to 66 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "ocm-mturansk".
Login Succeeded!

$ make deploy

$ ocm login --token=${OCM_ACCESS_TOKEN} --url=https://ocm-ex-service.apps-crc.testing --insecure

$ ocm post /api/ocm-example-service/v1/dinosaurs << EOF
{
    "species": "foo"
}
EOF
```



### Make a new Kind

1. Add to openapi.yaml
2. Generate the new structs/clients (`make generate`)
